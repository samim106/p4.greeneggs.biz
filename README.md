project 4

This application builds from P2. I have started from scratch and installed everything needed to re-learn the process of putting together the DB & configuring the environment & base files. It was a good learning experience again. 

I've extended P2 by changing all of the previous forms and links to use AJAX to call back to the server. This also includes giving the user status on the submissions they make. I've also included a messaging area where users can chat with each other. Simple form checking is also in my chat area to confirm each message is <144 characters. Users can also view their previous posts and keep going backwards every 20 messages. I asked Prof Susan and she said this was okay.

To really learn AJAX & JS more, I started creating a private chat client so users could speak with each other privately but I'm not that well-versed in JS so I want to continue it on my own after this class. I started it here:
http://p4.greeneggs.biz/msgs_private/
- js/msgs.js
- js/msgs_private.js
- controllers/c_msgs_private.php 
- views/v_msgs_private.php
I don't mean for it to be graded but I just wanted to say thanks for teaching this class because it's greatly advanced my understanding of JS since I had none before. And it's made me want to continue to learn more so thank you so much for your help throughout the semester!
